## 📖 Overview
**PrivacyGuard** is a high-performance security scanner designed to identify sensitive information, hardcoded credentials, and Personal Identifiable Information (PII) within source code and directories. It helps developers and security engineers prevent **Credential Leakage** and ensure **GDPR Compliance**.

---

## ✨ Key Features
* **Multi-Layered Detection**: Combines Regex patterns, Shannon Entropy, and Mathematical Validation.
* **Greek PII Support**: Specialized logic for validating Greek VAT numbers (AFM) using the **Modulo 11** algorithm.
* **Entropy-Based Discovery**: Detects high-entropy strings (e.g., AWS/Google Keys) even without predefined patterns.
* **Professional Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails in `scanner.log` with severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
* **CI/CD Ready**: Integrated GitHub Actions for automated quality assurance.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Detection Engines
* **Pattern Engine**: Utilizes optimized Regular Expressions for known formats (API Keys, Tokens).
* **Validation Engine**: Reduces False Positives by verifying checksums (e.g., Modulo 11 for Greek AFM).
* **Entropy Engine**: Calculates **Shannon Entropy** to flag suspicious high-randomness strings.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.10** or higher
* **Git** installed on your system

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/aspirlidaki/privacyguard.git](https://github.com/aspirlidaki/privacyguard.git)

# Enter the directory
cd privacyguard

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the scanner on a specific directory by providing the path:

Bash
python3 main.py --path ./samples --json
##🧪 Testing
We use automated unit tests to ensure detection accuracy and prevent regressions:

Bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
